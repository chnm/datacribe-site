      <description>Header text Before you create a project, your content will need to exist in Omeka S as items. DataScribe works with the items and items sets in your Omeka S install. You will build datasets using item sets, and these datasets will be made up of items.
Creating Omeka S resources Item sets DataScribe uses existing Omeka S item sets as the basis for datasets.
Each dataset has one transcription form.</description>
