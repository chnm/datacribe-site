How to set up everything you need to start working with DataScribe.

*Download* this information as a PDF.

In order to work with DataScribe you need to have a web hosting service or web space which meets the [system requirements for Omeka](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/install/#system-requirements).

## Step 1. Create an Omeka S install

If you do not already have an Omeka S installation, you will need to set one up.

If your hosting service uses Installatron or a similar service, you will be able to create an Omeka S instance using the one-click installation process. If your hosting service does not have a one-click option, download the latest version of Omeka S from <omeka.org/s> and follow the [installation instructions in the Omeka S User manual](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/install/).

## Step 2. Install DataScribe

[Download](https://omeka.org/s/modules/Datascribe-module/) the DataScribe module.

Follow the [instructions in the Omeka S user manual](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/#installing-modules) to install DataScribe in your Omeka S instance. Remember that once you have uploaded it to the /modules section of your Omeka S files, you need change the name of the module directory from Datascribe-module to Datascribe.

## Step 3. Create resources in Omeka

Add items to Omeka S. You can do this one by one or use [Omeka S importer and connector modules](https://omeka.org/s/modules/) for batch creation. For an example of using CSV Import to create resources for DataScribe, see Brett and Mitchell, “From Archival Sources To Computational Analysis” [Part One](https://deathbynumbers.org/2022/04/25/from-archival-sources-to-computational-analysis-part-one/) and [Part Two](https://deathbynumbers.org/2022/05/09/from-archival-sources-to-computational-analysis-part-two/).

Put those items into at least one [item set](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/content/item-sets/).

## Step 4. Start working with DataScribe

Now you can start using DataScribe: create a [project](https://github.com/chnm/Datascribe-module/wiki/Projects), add a [dataset](https://github.com/chnm/Datascribe-module/wiki/Datasets), build your [form](https://github.com/chnm/Datascribe-module/wiki/Datasets-forms), and start [transcribing](https://github.com/chnm/Datascribe-module/wiki/Transcribing-data).
