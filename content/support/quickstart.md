How to set up everything you need to start working with DataScribe <https://datascribe.tech>. In order to work with DataScribe you need to have a web hosting service or webspace which meets the system requirements for Omeka <https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/install/#system-requirements>.

## Step 1. Create an Omeka S install

If you do not already have an Omeka S installation, you will need to set one up. 

If your hosting service uses Installatron or a similar service, you will be able to create an Omeka S instance using the one-click installation process. If your hosting service does not have a one-click option, download the latest version of Omeka S from <omeka.org/s> and follow the installation instructions in the Omeka S User manual.

## Step 2. Install DataScribe
Download the DataScribe module. 
Follow the instructions in the Omeka S user manual to install DataScribe in your Omeka S instance. Remember that once you have uploaded it to the /modules section of your Omeka S files, you need change the name of the module directory from Datascribe-module to Datascribe.

## Step 3. Create resources in Omeka
Add items to Omeka S. You can do this one by one or use Omeka S importer and connector modules for batch creation.
See these blog posts for more information on using CSV Importer: “From Archival Sources To Computational Analysis” Part One and Part Two. 
Put those items into at least one item set.

## Step 4. Start working with DataScribe
Now you can start using DataScribe: create a project, add a dataset, build your form, and start transcribing.
