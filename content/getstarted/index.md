Before you create a project, your content will need to exist in Omeka S as items. DataScribe works with the items and items sets in your Omeka S install. You will build datasets using item sets, and these datasets will be made up of items.

## Creating Omeka S resources

### Item sets

DataScribe uses existing Omeka S item sets as the basis for datasets. 

Each dataset has one transcription form. You will need to create a unique item set for each form type you intend to create. For example, if you have data with variations over time - like the Bills of Mortality or the US Census - you will need to create different item sets for each variation in the form which you want to capture. 

### Items

You will also want to plan how you are defining items records in your dataset. For some projects, this will be fairly clear. For others, you may need to think more carefully - for example, a ledger with on page for credits and another for debts. Do you want to capture each page as a separate item? Or make all of those rows part of the same item, with an additional field for credit or debit. 

Think about what information you are going to need in the resulting dataset, and try working backwards.

### Supported filetypes

The DataScribe transcription interface currently supports:

- 'image/bmp'
- 'image/gif'
- 'image/jpeg'
- 'image/png'
- 'image/svg+xml'

If you have tiff or pdf images, you will need to convert them to one of the above formats.
