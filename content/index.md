## What is DataScribe?

Scholars often collect sources, such as government forms or
institutional records, intending to transcribe them into datasets which can be analyzed or visualized. This module enables scholars to identify the structure of the data within their sources, speed up the transcription of their sources, and reliably structure their transcriptions in a form amenable to computational analysis. Scholars can turn sources into tables of data stored as numbers, dates, categories, and more. Because this module builds on the Omeka S platform, it allows scholars to display transcriptions alongside the source images and metadata, to crowdsource transcriptions, and to publish their results on the web.

DataScribe has been made possible in part by a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities: Exploring the human endeavor.
