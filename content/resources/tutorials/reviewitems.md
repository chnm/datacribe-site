Reviewers will check transcriptions when transcribers have completed their work on each DataScribe item and submitted the *item* for review.  Reviewers can either approve the transcription or send it back to the transcriber to correct.

## Find an item to review

There are multiple ways to find the records for review. The easiest way is to look under My Projects and select All Items needing review under the dataset you wish to review.

On the dataset page, you can use the filter dropdown above the table of items to find items to review.

In the dropdown, select the “Items that need review” option. Click the Filter button to apply the filter.

You can sort these items based on title, the date the item was submitted for review, the item’s review history, and if the item is prioritized or not.

## Review an item

Once you find the item to review, select the item title to view the records page.

Your project guidelines should determine the relationship between records and items.

A red exclamation point icon next to any record number indicates a problem with the required fields in the records.  Other transcription issues, such as misspellings, accidentally skipping over fields, or illegible sections require the reviewer to check the entire form.

Depending on the level of review required by the project guidelines and the size of the form,  you may be able to scroll through the record table to see the entries without the item image.

### Reviewing the records

At this point, reviewing a transcription is a lot like transcribing one.

Click the pencil icon to go to the DataScribe form. When looking at an individual record, you can check the Needs Work  box in the Record Actions side bar. You can also leave notes on the record in the sidebar.

You an also leave notes on the item level under Item Actions on the Records table page. From here, you will click “save… and return to records.”

## Final actions

The final step is to set the *item* as either approved or not approved. In the Item Actions sidebar, use the Review status dropdown to select “Mark as approved” or “Mark as not approved.” Then use the Save button in the top right-hand corner.

If you have not approved the item, you should leave a note in the item or record to explain to the transcriber what issues they need to correct.
