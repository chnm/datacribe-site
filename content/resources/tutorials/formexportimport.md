summary: "How to export a form from an existing dataset and import it when creating a new dataset."
---

In a DataScribe project you may need to use the same or similar forms for multiple datasets. Rather than making the same form over and over, you can export the form from an existing dataset and reuse it. This is particularly helpful when you have longer forms.

Note that you can only import a form when you are adding a new dataset. You can’t import a form to an existing DataSet.

## Export the dataset form

To begin, go to the dataset where you have already built the form you want to use or modify.

Scroll all the way to the bottom of the dataset page.

In the right hand drawer there is a heading for "Export form". Below the heading is a link with the text "Click to export form (JSON)".

### Saving the form

Click on the link to download the form. Your browser should prompt you to chose a place on your computer to save the file. Choose a location which makes sense and where you can easily find the form. If you are going to be reusing the form, be sure to put it in a safe place.

The default title for the exported form is `form_export`. If you plan on using the form more than once, or are going to export multiple forms, rename the file before downloading.

## Import the dataset form

To import, I’ll start by making a new dataset.

On the new dataset form, there’s an option to Import form.

I’ll click to import and find the form we just saved.

Now I’ll fill out the other required information to create this dataset.

After I click add to save the new dataset

We can navigate to the dataset’s form and see that it exactly matches what we exported.

At this point I can use the form as-is. I can also add, delete, or modify fields as needed for this particular dataset.
