summary: "How to export a form from an existing dataset and import it when creating a new dataset."

In a DataScribe project you may need to use the same or similar forms for multiple datasets. Rather than making the same form over and over, you can export the form from an existing dataset and reuse it. This is particularly helpful when you have longer forms.

Note that you can only import a form when you are adding a new dataset. You can’t import a form to an existing DataSet.

To begin, go to the dataset where you have already built the form you want to use or modify.

Scroll all the way to the bottom of the dataset page.

In the right hand drawer there is a heading for "Export form". Below the heading is a link with the text "Click to export form (JSON)".

Click on the link to download the form. Your browser should prompt you to 

Now we need to select where to save the form. I will save it to the desktop but you may want to put it somewhere more useful or stable if you’re going to import it many times. 

The default title for the exported form is form_export. Again, you probably want to change this to something more helpful. 

I am going to call this “General Population” which matches the kind of dataset it’s used for.

Once this has saved, the export is complete. 

To import, I’ll start by making a new dataset. 

On the new dataset form, there’s an option to Import form. 

I’ll click to import and find the form we just saved.

Now I’ll fill out the other required information to create this dataset. 

After I click add to save the new dataset

We can navigate to the dataset’s form and see that it exactly matches what we exported. 

At this point I can use the form as-is. I can also add, delete, or modify fields as needed for this particular dataset.
