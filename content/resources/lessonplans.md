## Building forms to transcribe structured historical data

This lesson uses the form building worksheet to help students understand the decisions which are involved in going from a historical source with structured data to a quantitative analysis or visualization. Students  will learn about the options (like controlled vocabularies) which can help ensure tidy data but might also create omissions in the dataset.

The activity should be part of a larger conversation about structured data, historical data, and how humanists create machine-readable datasets. There is an appendix with suggested readings at the end of the lesson plan.
