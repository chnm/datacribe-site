## Religious Ecologies

In the following case study we describe how the [American Religious Ecologies project](https://religiousecologies.org/) at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media utilized DataScribe to transcribe tabular data from early twentieth-century digitized census forms in order to create a new dataset for American religious history. Because DataScribe was still under development when our team started transcription, we first used a basic spreadsheet structure for transcription and transitioned to DataScribe mid-way through the project. In this study, we will provide an overview of the American Religious Ecologies project and the sources we used. We will also detail the process of digitizing and readying our sources for transcription, the transition from using spreadsheets to using DataScribe for transcription, the workflows we developed for transcribing and reviewing, DataScribe as a project management tool, the final format of the data coming out of DataScribe, and the questions and visualizations this new dataset enabled. Finally, we discuss the decisions we made along the way. In total, this study will give you a better sense of how DataScribe was used by a diverse team at a University-based research center, and how it became a critical part of our efforts to transcribe thousands of sources, create new datasets and asynchronously manage a large-scale transcription project.

## Death by Numbers

This [project](https://deathbynumbers.org) transcribe and publish the information in the London Bills of Mortality from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries into a dataset suitable for computational analysis.
